- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fauferis;
- ðŸ‘€ Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I am an IT graduate with knowledge and practical experience in network administration, operating systems and programming. Throughout my studies and projects, I have gained hands-on skills in designing and managing computer networks, working with security solutions, and exploring virtualization and server environments. 
I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world environments, contribute to innovative IT projects, and continue growing as a technology professional.
